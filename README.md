# NLMeans-CUDA
This project implements the well-known Non-local means algorithm that is used for Image Denoising, both in a CPU version (for comparison purposes) and (most interestingly) in a CUDA version that takes advantage of the higher computing capabilities of a GPGPU for this type of problems compared to a conventional multicore CPU. The project was developed for the purposes of the course "Parallel and Distributed Systems", ECE AUTh.

Below is a presentation of each version in more detail (Further explanations on how to execute each version and how code works are given on the report.pdf):

`Sequential Version`: Implementation of Non-local means on CPU

`Multithreaded Version`: Parallel Implementation of Non-local means on CPU using multiple cores with OpenMP library (default thread count is set to 4)

`V1 Version`: CUDA Implementation of Non-local means using only GPU's global memory during computations

`V2 Version`: CUDA implementation of Non-local means that stores Gaussian Kernel on constant memory and also takes advantage of shared memory that GPU provides

## Compilation - Run

To run the below code versions successfully open a terminal in the main folder of the project and place the desired `.png` image on the subdirectory `./images/`. The `libpng` C library should be installed on the system, for more information visit the official site http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html. (Note: The output images are in grayscale form and are placed on the `images` dir). The project development was performed on a Ubuntu 18.04 system, using nvcc --version=V9.1.85. To someone who faces cross platform compatibility issues (or issues related to libpng), HPC AUTh infastructure can be used (https://hpc.it.auth.gr/).

Run the sequential version with

    make sequential
    ./nlmeans_seq.out "./images/someImage.png"

 Similarly run the cuda versions with

    make cuda_global
    ./nlmeans_v1.out "./images/someImage.png"
    make cuda_shared
    ./nlmeans_v2.out "./images/someImage.png"

To run each version with the default inputs (E-learning given image with N = 64 and patchsize = 5) simply run

    make test_seq
    make test_cuda_global
    make test_cuda_shared


To run on HPC AUTh infastructure simply copy the whole project folder there and submit:

    sbatch job.sh
    sbatch seq_job.sh

## Correctness - Validation
The correctness of the output image that each version produces can be checked on the site <a id="1/">https://online-image-comparison.com/</a> by uploading the image that each version produces (If 2 images are the same the result should not show any red signs - Insert a small 'Fuzz' value to detect even small differences). To verify the equality of two images with C simply run:

    make validation

To decide which 2 versions to validate you have to modify just the 2 filenames at differences.cpp (More detailed info on the file)
Note:You should first run the 2 versions you are about to validate, with 0.0 NOISE_STD (parameters.hpp). All the above images produced (N size: {64,128,256} and patch size {3,5,7}) were checked with the second option which (obviously) is more precise.
